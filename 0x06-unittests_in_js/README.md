Express API Test Suites

This repository contains a series of tasks related to setting up an Express API and writing comprehensive test suites using Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and chai-http. Each task builds upon the previous one, progressively introducing new concepts and challenges.

Project Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each task:

0-calculations: Introduces basic test setup using Mocha and Chai.

1-calculations-advanced: Extends the previous task by adding more complex calculations and testing.

2-calculations-chai: Implements tests using Chai's expect syntax.

3-payment-system: Creates a payment system and tests various payment scenarios.

4-payment-stubs: Utilizes Sinon to stub methods for more controlled testing.

5-payment-multiple-tests: Writes multiple tests for different payment scenarios.

6-payment-promises: Introduces asynchronous testing using Promises.

7-skip-tests: Demonstrates skipping tests using Mocha's it.skip.

8-api: Contains the Express API setup with a basic route and initial test suite.

9-api: Reuses the previous project, adding a new route and corresponding test suite.

10-api: Builds upon the previous project, introducing additional endpoints and their test suites.
